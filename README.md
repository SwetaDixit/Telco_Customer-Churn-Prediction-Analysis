# Telecom Churn Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for performing telecom churn analysis using the Telecom Churn dataset from Kaggle. Churn analysis is crucial for telecom companies to understand customer behavior and identify potential churners, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on Kaggle: [Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset). It contains information about telecom customers including their usage patterns, account information, and whether they churned or not.

## Analysis

In this project, we explore the dataset to understand the factors influencing churn and build predictive models to identify potential churners. The analysis includes:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of variables, identifying correlations, and visualizing trends.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
3. Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict churn based on customer features.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
5. Interpretation: Analyzing model results to understand the factors contributing to churn and derive actionable insights.

## Files

- `telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (`telecom_churn.csv`) used in the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/telecom-churn-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd telecom-churn-analysis
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open `telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the analysis.

## Results
