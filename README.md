Business Problem:-
The telecommunications industry is characterized by intense competition, providing customers with numerous service provider options. Consequently, operators face a substantial challenge in retaining their customer base, with an average annual churn rate ranging from 15-20%. This high churn rate poses a significant concern for telecom companies due to the exorbitant costs associated with acquiring new customers—typically 5-10 times more expensive than retaining existing ones

Project Summary :-
Telco customer churn remains a significant challenge for the industry, with an average annual churn rate of 15-20%. To address this issue, identifying the reasons for customer defection is crucial.Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to explore the factors contributing to customer churn and develop predictive models to forecast customer behavior. The ultimate goal is to design effective customer retention programs and improve cross-functional collaboration to minimize churn and boost customer loyalty.

With these assumptions in mind, the project aims to develop predictive models that can identify which customers are at risk of churning and provide insights on how to retain them. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, the models will analyze a range of customer and service-related variables to forecast customer behavior and inform retention strategies.
